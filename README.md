## 🧠 What’s Inside?

Think of it as a one-page personal portfolio, but purely handcrafted with love and code.

📄 `index.html` – The structure of the resume  
🎨 `style.css` – The vibes, the layout, the visuals  
📘 `README.md` – You’re reading it 😄

## 🎯 Why This Exists

I wanted a quick, elegant way to showcase my resume without needing recruiters to download a file or open Google Drive links. So... this happened.

- No frameworks  
- No JavaScript  
- Just me, some HTML/CSS, and coffee ☕
